A test of the new website, deployed on github pages.  Errr, I guess this post can be about how I did it?  Look, just follow [this tutorial](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-blog.html) okay.  

Here's some python code I guess?

```{python}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.scatter([1,2], [1,2])
fig.show()
```
